Assignment: PROJECT 3

LAB Synopsis:

This project was on implementing our own hash table and function, and then solving a word puzzle in fast runtime.

Some obstacles were creating a good hash function, but the textbook provided a detailed explanation on how to implement one.
Another obstacle was extracting the characters from the different orientations, it was difficult to generate all 
the different possible combinations.   

HashTable class contains methods and constructor to create a hash table. Hash function was created by using the course text
as a guide to make a "good" hash function. DoubleNode, DoublyLinkedList, MyDoublyLinkedList, MyQueue, and Queue class
were used to create a queue for use in program. 

WordFinder class contains a main method and helper method to test my implementation of solving the word puzzle.
